TACHYMETER FOR MULTI BRUSHLESS AIRFRAME 

GOALS

    The need is to get precise rotation velocity measurement on a UAV
 equipped with as much as 8 brushless engines, with a refresh rate of
 1khz, using hall effect sensor and/or one ESC output background
 information



portage to definitive hardware should be easy thanks to ChibiOS
Hardware Abstraction Layer.




 WHAT’S DONE

* software

° implement TIM12 pwm input on ChibiOS HAL (not
supported on mainline since interrupt vectors are shared for TIM12 on
some platform, but that’s not the case for STM32F4/F7)

° all the 8 pwm input timer of MCU are used sensing of up to 8 motors with hall effect
sensor

° send speed message on UART

° send confidence of measure message
on UART if hall sensors don’t give signal with good shape confidence
message are sent only if bad measure is detected on at least one
sensor

° msg rate is 930hz for 8 motors, 1800hz for two motors,
@230kbaud message are sent in continuous mode, not @ fixed rate

° uart speed can be increased to raise message rate

° get configuration (number of motor, ESC or HALL mode) from jumper (or
solder bridge)

° filtering on data : window average + median filter


* hardware

° breadboard to test hall effect sensor : the one we have in
test has a position tolerance of 2 millimeters from outer rotor


° breadboard to test opto coupler for ESC phase using only passive
components the one we have tested (Logic Analyser only) has a very
limited bandwidth and shadows pwm pulses.


° engine : EMAX RSII 2306 engine magnet are easier to
detect than previously tested motor, and we can achieve tests without
any bad measure on the bench.


TODO LIST

* software

° implement ESC signal processing to guess speed
from ESC output

° get/set configuration via messages : UART link can be
used in full duplex to permit flight controler to configure tachymeter
(number of engine, ESC ou HALL mode, data rate, etc)

° use dshot controller @high frequency (4khz) to change at fast pace engine rpm
and see if we can observe engine response.

* hardware

° test other brand/model of hall effect sensors so see if some
models are more position tolerant than the first we have tested.

° test other brand/model of optocoupler to find one with higher bandwidth

° design stm32f722 64 pins based specific card with electronic to
connect hall effect sensor (need pullup resistor), or direct ESC
connection (need optocoupler + passive or active components).

stm32f7 is priced identically but is twice as powerfull. drawback is it has
less flash memory (512ko) than stm32f4 (1024ko), but firmware will
stay way below 512ko


° test in real condition with vibrations to see hall sensor behavior in
real life


° what are the minimum and maximum number of
battery cell we went to support (from 2S to 6S ?) ?
