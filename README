TACHYMETER FOR MULTI BRUSHLESS AIRFRAME 

GOALS

    The need is to get precise rotation velocity measurement on a UAV
 equipped with as much as 8 brushless engines, with a refresh rate of
 1 kHz, using hall effect sensor and/or one ESC output background
 information.



Portage to different hardware should be easy thanks to ChibiOS
Hardware Abstraction Layer.




 WHAT’S DONE

* software

° implement TIM12 pwm input on ChibiOS HAL (not
supported on mainline since interrupt vectors are shared for TIM12 on
some platform, but that’s not the case for STM32F4/F7)

° all the 8 pwm input timer of MCU are used sensing of up to 8 motors with hall effect
sensor

° send speed message on UART

° send confidence of measure message
on UART if hall sensors don’t give signal with good shape confidence
error message are sent only if bad measure is detected on at least one
sensor.
Total number of erroneous data senses can be recorded and printed via shell if
makefile variable UPDATE_TOTAL_ERRORS is set to 1

° message are sent at a configurable fixed rate

° uart baud rate can be increased to raise message (via shell)

° set/get configuration to/from eeprom via serial messages or shell commands

° filtering on data : window average + median filter. theses filter parameters
  can be configured via serial messages or shell commands


* hardware

° hall effect sensor position tolerence
  + 2 millimetres for RSII-2306
  + 0.5  millimetres for MK3638 which has better magnetic shield (good for
         motor efficiency, bad for hall effect sensing)


° opto coupler solution has been tested (can be enabled with makefile variable OPTOCOUPLER_ON_BOARD)
  but not implemented in hardware for octotacho v0 hardware.



TODO LIST

* software

° implement ESC signal processing to guess speed
from ESC output in any condition

° test in real condition with vibrations to see hall sensor behaviour in
real life


* documentation

° user manual
